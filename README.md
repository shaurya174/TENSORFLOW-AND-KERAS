# 1. 💎 Gemstone Price Prediction

This is the first project in my deep learning portfolio. It focuses on predicting the price of rare gemstones based on physical measurements using a neural network built with Keras.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to estimate the price of newly mined gemstones using machine learning so that sellers can set fair market prices. The dataset includes two measurement features and a target variable (price).

## 🚀 Workflow Summary

- **Data Exploration:** Used pandas and seaborn to understand the data.
- **Preprocessing:** Applied MinMaxScaler after splitting the data.
- **Modeling:** Built a 4-layer neural network using TensorFlow's Keras API.
- **Training:** Trained the model over 400 epochs.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluated predictions using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score.
- **Visualization:** Compared predicted vs actual prices.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras

## 🚀 Workflow Summary

- **Data Exploration:** Explored distributions, correlations, and target class balance using pandas and seaborn.
- **Preprocessing:** Applied MinMaxScaler after splitting the data into train and test sets.
- **Modeling:** Built and compared three neural networks — baseline, EarlyStopping, and Dropout-regularized — using TensorFlow's Keras API.
- **Training:** Trained the models and monitored training/validation loss to detect overfitting.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluated performance using a classification report, confusion matrix, and accuracy metrics.
- **Visualization:** Plotted loss curves to visually compare model behaviors and learning trends.
