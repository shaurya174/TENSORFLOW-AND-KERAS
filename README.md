# 1. 💎 Gemstone Price Prediction

This is the first project in my deep learning portfolio. It focuses on predicting the price of rare gemstones based on physical measurements using a neural network built with Keras.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to estimate the price of newly mined gemstones using machine learning so that sellers can set fair market prices. The dataset includes two measurement features and a target variable (price).

## 🚀 Workflow Summary

- **Data Exploration:** Used pandas and seaborn to understand the data.
- **Preprocessing:** Applied MinMaxScaler after splitting the data.
- **Modeling:** Built a 4-layer neural network using TensorFlow's Keras API.
- **Training:** Trained the model over 400 epochs.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluated predictions using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score.
- **Visualization:** Compared predicted vs actual prices.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras

# 2. 🏠	 House Price Prediction with Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses deep learning (Keras + TensorFlow) to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location coordinates, and more. The dataset is taken from **King County, USA**, which includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.
